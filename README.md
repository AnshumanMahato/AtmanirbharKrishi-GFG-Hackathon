# Atmanirbhar Krishi
 
Project for GeeksForGeeks GoogleXAmd Hackathon.

## What are the problems being addressed and how to solve them?

As per the Situation Assessment Survey (SAS), Average monthly income per agricultural household in India is ₹10,218. 
Solution: This project tries to give farmers more monthly income.

The only choice of farmers to sell their produce is through APMC. But they could get very good profits if sold directly to customers. But it has various problems associated with it
- They don’t have the reach. 
	- Solution: Our platform will provide them the reach they need.
- They can’t ensure transportation and delivery.
	- Solution: Our platform will build a network for easy transportation and delivery.
- Customers need milled products.
	- Solution: Our platform will connect the millers as well.

- But isn't it going to be hard for the farmers? Are they literate enough to do it by themselves?
	- Solution: We are going to make the process as much easier as possible. For farmers it would be to just update the price, amount of stock and sometimes images. For those who are illiterate, our agents will make sure their operations run smoothly. 
	- Extra: Agents are the local students who are above 18.
